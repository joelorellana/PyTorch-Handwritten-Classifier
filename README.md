# MNIST Handwritten Digit Classifier

## Project Overview
This project involves building a neural network model to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a large database of handwritten digits that is widely used for training and testing in the field of machine learning. This project aims to achieve high accuracy in digit recognition by implementing a custom neural network architecture and comparing its performance against benchmark results.

## Key Features
- **Custom Neural Network Architecture**: Design and implement a neural network tailored for high accuracy in digit recognition.
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Compare model performance with historical benchmarks, including those achieved by prominent researchers in the field.
- **Data Familiarization**: Provides an opportunity to understand the intricacies of the MNIST dataset, which is critical for developing effective machine learning models.

## Installation
This project requires Python and several dependencies which can be installed via the provided `requirements.txt` file. To set up your environment, please follow these steps:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/joelorellana/PyTorch-Handwritten-Classifier.git
